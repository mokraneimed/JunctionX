A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

to use the app:
- install flutter
- clone the repo
- install the dependencies
- run the app
- the authentification is not ready yet, so to use the app press any button in the authentification page like "Sign in" button (like in the demo), and it will take you to the home page.
